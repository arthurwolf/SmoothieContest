    You need a project that makes Smoothie better in some way.<br/><br/>
    There are lots of different things you can do : <br/>

    <div class="row marketing">
    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <h4>Documentation</h4>
      <p>We are pretty proud to have good <a href="http://smoothieware.org/">documentation</a>. But you can always make it better, clearer, and more extensive. Documentation is awesome.</p>

      <h4>Code</h4>
      <p>Always things to add, always things to make better. New functionalities are always welcome, existing ones often want love.</p>

      <h4>Machine</h4>
      <p>Use Smoothie to control something nobody has controlled with it before. And tell us how you did it. Lots of options here.</p>

      <h4>Whatever</h4>
      <p>Because you'll think of something we didn't.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <h4>Guides</h4>
      <p>Because not having to read the whole documentation to learn to do one thing is good. We have full guides for <a href="http://smoothieware.org/3d-printer-guide">3D printers</a>, <a href="http://smoothieware.org/laser-cutter-guide">laser cutters</a>, and <a href="http://smoothieware.org/CNC-Mill-guide">CNC mills</a>, but there are many others to add.</p>

      <h4>Graphics</h4>
      <p>We are coders. We suck at drawing. We need your art.</p>

      <h4>Reviews</h4>
      <p>You have an audience, and you give your honest opinion about things. We need you to talk about Smoothieboard. No requirement to say good things, but we know you will.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" role="alert"><h4>Not too inspired ?</h4> 
        But still want to win ? We have a list of good ideas <a href="#"> here </a>
    </div>

    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
        <h2>So everybody wins ?</h2>
        <footer> Well not exactly. That'd be super-duper though. </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h3> How many winners ? </h3>

    <p>We have <strong>30</strong> boards to give for this contest.</p>
    <p>That's actually quite a bit of value if you do the math. But we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA6_3nwf-U4">really</a> want awesome things to happen.</p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger" role="alert"><h4> Wait what, you're giving away 30 boards ?</h4> 
        <p> Sure. Want one ? </p> 
    </div>

    <h3> And who wins ? </h3>
    <p> When we have everybody's project in hand, we'll ask the community for help and ultimately choose the 30 we judge the best and most awesome contributions to the project. </p>
    <p> And those 30 each get a Smoothieboard ! </p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" role="alert"><h4>If you don't win don't worry.</h4> 
      <p> We plan on doing this again ! <br/>
      And contributions are very welcome at any time, contest or not.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
        <h2>Until when can I submit a project ?</h2>
        <footer> End of november </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p> You have until december 1st 2014 to submit your project. </p>
    <p> After that, we'll be choosing projects very fast, and awesomeness should ensue</a>

    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
        <h2>Where do I submit a project ?</h2>
        <footer> Right here </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p> You submit your project by email at <a href="mailto:wolf.arthur@gmail.com">wolf.arthur@gmail.com</a> </p>

    <p> After working with you to define and understand your project, we'll publish it on this website. </p>

    <p>
        <a href="mailto:wolf.arthur@gmail.com" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg center-block"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span>  Submit your project</a> 
    </p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" role="alert"><h4>If you have questions</h4> 
      <p> About anything, don't hesitate to write too ! </p>
    </div>


    


















    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
        <h2>Who is doing this ?</h2>
        <footer> Us ! </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p> This is a joint effort between <a href="http://uberclock.com">Uberclock</a> and <a href="http://robotseed.com">Robotseed</a>, the two companies currently producing and selling the Smoothieboard. Our two companies are also run by folks that actively contribute to the project, and this contest is a part of that. </p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
        <h2>Why do this ?</h2>
        <footer> Many reasons ! </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h3> Enabling </h3>

    <p>From time to time we hear somebody saying something like : </p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p> « I have an awesome idea of something to add to Smoothie, but I don't have a Smoothieboard. And I can't get one right now » </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p> That breaks our hearts. Sometimes we can do something, sometimes we can't. Right now we can, and we'd like to find as many people like this as possible </p>

    <h3> Involving </h3>

    <p> Contributing to an Open-Source project is easier than it seems. But not everybody necessarily realizes that </p>

    <p> Contributing to Smoothie is easy. That's actually one of the main design goals for the project. If you want to help us, we want to make your life as easy as possible ( the code is actually structured <a href="http://smoothieware.org/moduleexample">with that in mind</a> ). </p>

    <p> But that's not something that is in any way obvious, or easy to show. So the best way to get people to see it is give them a good reason to try it. </p>

    <h3> Giving back </h3>

    <p> <a href="https://github.com/arthurwolf">I</a> was part of the first <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1"> Google Summer of Code </a>. And it was awesome ! </p>

    <p> We are not Google. But it is nonetheless an inspiring initiative. And we'd like to do as much as we can to move things forward </p>

    <h3> Awareness </h3>

    <p> How many times do we hear things like : </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p> « Wait, Smoothie can do <strong> that </strong> ? » </p>
        <footer> Everybody we talk to </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p> or </p> 

    <blockquote>
        <p> « I had no idea it was that far along. This is so much easier to use than what I was using before. » </p>
        <footer> A newcomer </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p> or also </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p> « I was surprised how easy it was to add my stuff to it. » </p>
        <footer> A new contributor </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p> That's pretty frustrating to hear : we have an awesome community that made something awesome, and is making it better all the time, but in the wider Open-Source CNC community, there is not much awareness about what is possible with it, and even about what it is exactly. </p>

    <p> Everybody is used to using other things, and to what is possible with those, so we have a hard time getting the word out about what makes Smoothie the project we love. </p> 

    <p> So we thought a contest was a good way to showcase what's already so awesome about it, what's currently being added, and how easy it is to add things to Smoothie. </p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" role="alert"><h4> « Smoothie is awesome, Smoothie is this and that » ... There are other awesome CNC projects around ! </h4> 
      <p> Sure, we love everything Open-Source ! Go look at other projects, maybe there are some better suited for you. <br/>
      </p>
    </div>
