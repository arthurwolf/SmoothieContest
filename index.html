    You need a project that makes Smoothie better in some way.<br/><br/>
    There are lots of different things you can do : <br/>

    <div class="row marketing">
    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <h4>Documentation</h4>
      <p>We are pretty proud to have good <a href="http://smoothieware.org/">documentation</a>. But you can always make it better, clearer, and more extensive. Documentation is awesome.</p>

      <h4>Code</h4>
      <p>Always things to add, always things to make better. New functionalities are always welcome, existing ones often want love.</p>

      <h4>Machine</h4>
      <p>Use Smoothie to control something nobody has controlled with it before. And tell us how you did it. Lots of options here.</p>

      <h4>Whatever</h4>
      <p>Because you'll think of something we didn't.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <h4>Guides</h4>
      <p>Because not having to read the whole documentation to learn to do one thing is good. We have full guides for <a href="http://smoothieware.org/3d-printer-guide">3D printers</a>, <a href="http://smoothieware.org/laser-cutter-guide">laser cutters</a>, and <a href="http://smoothieware.org/CNC-Mill-guide">CNC mills</a>, but there are many others to add.</p>

      <h4>Graphics</h4>
      <p>We are coders. We suck at drawing. We need your art.</p>

      <h4>Reviews</h4>
      <p>You have an audience, and you give your honest opinion about things. We need you to talk about Smoothieboard. No requirement to say good things, but we know you will.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" role="alert"><h4>Not too inspired ?</h4> 
        But still want to participate ? We have a list of good ideas <a href="#ideas-list"> here </a>
    </div>

    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
        <h2>So everybody wins ?</h2>
        <footer> Well not exactly. That'd be super-duper though. </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h3> How many winners ? </h3>

    <p>We have <strong>30</strong> boards to give for this contest.</p>
    <p>That's actually quite a bit of value if you do the math. But we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA6_3nwf-U4">really</a> want awesome things to happen.</p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger" role="alert"><h4> Wait what, you're giving away 30 boards ?</h4> 
        <p> Sure. Want one ? </p> 
    </div>

    <h3> And who wins ? </h3>
    <p> When we have everybody's project in hand, we'll ask the community for help and ultimately choose the 30 we judge the best and most awesome contributions to the project. </p>
    <p> And those 30 each get a Smoothieboard ! Immediately after being selected. </p>
    <p> Then they do their project, and everybody gets increased awesomeness </p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" role="alert"><h4>If you don't win don't worry.</h4> 
      <p> We plan on doing this again ! <br/>
      And contributions are very welcome at any time, contest or not.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
        <h2>Until when can I submit a project ?</h2>
        <footer> End of november </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p> You have until december 1st 2014 to submit your project. </p>
    <p> After that, we'll be choosing projects very fast, and awesomeness should ensue. Winners get their boards as soon as they are chosen.</a>

    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
        <h2>Where do I submit my project ?</h2>
        <footer> Right here </footer>

    <p> You submit your project by email at <a href="mailto:wolf.arthur@gmail.com">wolf.arthur@gmail.com</a> </p>

    <p> After working with you to define and understand your project, we'll publish it on this website. </p>

    <p>
        <a href="mailto:wolf.arthur@gmail.com" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg center-block"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span>  Submit your project</a>

        <h2 id="ideas-list">Have any ideas of projects to do ?</h2>
        <footer> Sure ! </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p> Some of you will know right away what you want to submit for the contest. Others might not feel inspired, or not know enough about the Smoothie project yet to have an idea what to do. Bellow is a list of things we know Smoothie needs. </p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" role="alert"><h4>These are just examples</h4> 
      <p> No requirement whatsoever to choose from this list, all ideas welcome, even if they are not from this list and not variations on ideas from this list. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger" role="alert"><h4>You get help</h4> 
      <p> Some of these might seem hard, but you won't be left alone ! For most of them we already know what needs to be done, and how to do them. We may even have some code already. We'll help you as much as you need. </p>

                      <div class="modal-body">
                          <p> An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_solution"> arm solution </a> is a set of equations that allow a controller like Smoothie to control a specific type of robot with a given geometry.</p>
                          <p> Simply put, an arm solution translates spatial positions ( XYZ ) into actuator positions ( motor movements ). It also has to do the opposite. The user provides a target position, and Smoothie has to translate that into actual movement </p>
                          <p> The most common arm solution is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_robot"> cartesian arm solution </a>, in which the requested spatial position is directly proportional to the actuator's positions. </p>
                          <p> A good example of a more complex arm solution is the <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Rostock"> linear delta arm solution </a> which requires some trigonometry to do the conversion. </p>
                          <h4> In Smoothie </h4>
                          <p> In Smoothie, arm solutions are abstracted away. This means you only have to add one, separate file, to add an arm solution </p>
                          <p> All the code for that arm solution is contained in that file. This allows you to add a new arm solution without having to dig into the code or even understand too much about how things work under the hood. </p>
                          <h4> As a project </h4>
                          <p> If you have a machine that requires an unusual ( currently unsupported ) arm solution, or plan to build one, adding it to Smoothie would make a great contest entry. </p>

                          <p> Smoothie has basic spindle control ( ON/OFF ) using the <a href="http://smoothieware.org/switch"> Switch </a> module.</p>
                          <p> However, that's pretty limited if you have something more complicated than a dremel on your CNC mill/router, and if you want rotation speed control. </p>
                          <p> Most serious machines have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-frequency_drive"> VFDs </a> controlling their Spindles. Those have a panel that allow you to manually turn them on and off, and set the rotation speed </p>
                          <p> Wouldn't it be nice if you could use Smoothie to control all of that ? </p>
                          <p> Great news ! The most common of those VFDs have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485"> RS-485 </a> serial interfaces allowing you to control pretty much everything </p>
                          <p> Even better : <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/113179837473309823193"> +Miguel Sánchez </a> recently created some <a href="http://fightpc.blogspot.fr/2014/10/vfd-control-with-arduino-using-rs485.html"> Arduino code </a> to do this </p>
                          <p> So, a good contest entry would be porting this code as a module for Smoothie. Not too hard to do, but ideally you'd need to have a compatible VFD on-hand to test the code with </a>

                        <p> But say you want to engrave a raster image. Well we don't have that yet. </p>
                        <p> The microcontroller is capable of it. Actually <a href="https://github.com/logxen"> Logxen </a> created a <a href="https://github.com/logxen/Smoothie/tree/laser_engrave"> branch </a> to do just that back in 2012.</p>
                        <p> It gave some interresting results, unfortunately since then the code structure has changed and that code won't work anymore </p>
                        <p> However, we know what needs to be done, and there is already a good part of the code done. </p>
                        <p> If you have a laser ( even a small one attached to a 3D printer ), this is a pretty good entry for the contest </p>

                        <p> There are two paths here, an easy one and a hard one. Both are valid, but the hard one allows to reach optimal engraving speed </p>
                        <p> The easy way is to code a Smoothie module that take a bitmap image and interprets it as G-code that it feeds back into Smoothie itself.</p>
                        <p> The hard way is to have a module that reads the bitmap image, and directly controls the motors and laser. </p>

                        <p> Smoothie has a very nice feature : composite USB. If you plug the board into a computer, you can access it's virtual Serial port to talk to it, but it also shows up as a mass storage device, exposing the contents of it's SD card
                        to the user </p>
                        <p> That's super convenient as it allows you to edit configuration super easily, and drag/drop G-code files directly to the board. </p>
                        <p> However, we have a tad of a problem : on some setups of some versions of Windows, it appears our code does something the OS doesn't like, and that occasionally ( for some people even often ) causes bugs. </p> 
                        <p> There are workarounds for users affected, but those involve disabling some functionality ( specificaly the Mass storage feature ), which makes us very sad. </p> 
                        <p> If you know USB well, and happen to have a USB analyzer ( or know USB so well you'd spot this kind of thing without one ), this is a contest entry your skills could make quite easy </p>

                        <p> The Smoothie Project is built upon the open source ARM mbed development platform. The built in mbed library for I2C is "blocking". This means the processor has to wait for comms to finish before continuing, which makes communication with outside chips ineffecient. </p>
                        <p> There are some user submitted non-blocking libraries available to start from on the mbed site. <a href="http://developer.mbed.org/users/Sissors/code/MODI2C/"> Link </a>  </p>
                        <p> Someone needs to take the MOD lib and make sure it has all the features Smoothie needs, such as supporting the specific ports we use. Then the new lib needs to be integrated into Smoothieware. </p>

                        <p> Smoothie currently supports 3-axis coordinates ( XYZ / Cartesian ) input, and 3 actuators for movement output. </p>
                        <p> That's fine in lots of situations, we have several arm solutions for which 3 inputs and 3 outputs are good enough </p>
                        <p> Plus we have additional axes in the form of unlimited extruder ( specialized rotary axes ) modules </p>
                        <p> However, there are things that can be added to make things awesomer. Some are easy, some are hard, all are good contest entries. Here's a list : </p>                       
                        <h4> General use rotary axes</h4>
                        <p> This is the easy one. Right now you could use an <a href="http://smoothieware.org/extruder"> Extruder </a> module as a general purpose rotary axis.</p>
                        <p> However that's a bit of a hack, there are functionalities in there you wouldn't need, and others that might interfere. </p>
                        <p> Coding a general purpose rotary axis module would be pretty much as easy as doing a fairly simple rewrite of the Extruder module, and thing through exactly how the module would be used as to make it convenient. </p>

                        <h4> Add more actuator outputs</h4>
                        <p> Some arm solutions work with cartesian coordinates as an input, but require more than three actuators as an output</p>
                        <p> Smoothie already has support for unlimited actuators ( that's what allows us to have unlimited extruders ). However, the arm solutions still support only 3 actuators as an output. </p>
                        <p> It shouldn't be too hard to modify the arm solution abstraction to support more than 3 actuators, it would make a good contest entry, and would open the way to the next item in this list : </p>

                        <h4> Add more coordinates to the planner </h4>
                        <p> While cartesian coordinates are often enough ( XYZ as input ), some machines need more : rotational coordinates. That's the case for example of 5-axis CNC milling machines, or complex robotic arms </p>
                        <p> Adding this to Smoothie is the most complicated item in this list, because it requires modifying the look-ahead queue, and acceleration planning math. </p>
                        <p> However, if you feel like this is something you could do, this is a very welcome contribution. And we can help </p>

                        <p> The pretty dumb "bang-bang" methode, that just turns temperature on or off when bellow or above a set temperature point </p>
                        <p> And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller"> PID </a> which uses a feedback loop and some clever math to maintain a set temperature </p>

                        <p> Smoothie currently only supports stepper motors with step/direction interfaces. </p>
                        <p> That's what it has on-board, and it can also easily connect ( the right pins are broken out ) to external stepper motor drivers. </p>
                        <p> Some servo drivers also have step/direction interfaces, and those are compatible </p>
                        <p> However, someone might want to control small hobby servo motors using Smoothieboard </p>
                        <p> Luckily Smoothie has abstracted actuators away. This means that if you code a special type of actuator to handle hobby servos, you shouldn't need to change anything else in Smoothie. </p>
                        <p> You'd just need to make a new version of <a href="https://github.com/Smoothieware/Smoothieware/blob/edge/src/libs/StepperMotor.cpp"> StepperMotor </a> and some code to allow the user to configure an actuator as a hobby servo
                        and there you go, you'd pretty much be able to control a whole machine using all of smoothie's niceness, that was moved by hobby servos. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Low-Cost-Hobby-Servo-XY-Table"> Something like this </a> </p>

                        <p> 3D printers go fast nowadays. As they go faster and faster, they have to melt more and more filament. And sometimes they have a hard time doing that, as the filament won't flow well enough at high speeds. </p>
                        <p> It's been theorized a solution to this problem : heat the hotend more as speed rises. </p>
                        <p> This should make the molten filament more viscous and allow it to pass the hotend more easily </p>
                        <p> This is not too hard to add to the Extruder module : it's already aware of the current speed ( though you may need to work with an average of recent values ), and is linked to a TemperatureControl module </p>
                        <p> It's not guaranteed this will solve the problem, but it's a good idea to try things, and this is a pretty easy contest entry. </p>

                          <p> Smoothie uses acceleration when moving. This means we start slow, accelerate, and then when arriving at our destination, decelerate to a reasonable speed </p>
                          <p> This prevents stepper motors from skipping steps, and helps your machine shake a lot less at high speeds when changing directions </p>
                          <p> However, when extruding plastics in a hotend, this can cause a problem : because there is a small delay between the moment the extruder pushes filament into the hotend
                          and the moment it gets out of the hotend, this means a bit too much plastic will get out when accelerating/decelerating, and a bit of plastic will be missing in the middle 
                          of the move </p>

                          <p> A solution to this is as follows : add a number of steps to the current extruder position proportional to the current machine speed. </p>

                          <p> While Smoothie should work as-is for basic CNC lathe machining work, one thing is missing </p>
                          <p> X/Z movement is exactly the same thing as what you use for a CNC mill, so that works. But a lathe has something special : rotation </p>
                          <p> If that's controlled correctly it allows you to do crazy things like threading. </p>
                          <p> But that requires Smoothie to be aware of the exact speed of the rotation, and the exact position of the chuck. </p>
                          <p> So one would need to add encoder reading and speed control to a special Lathe module in Smoothie to allow for all of this. </p>
                          <p> While it's only moderately difficult, it requires you own or have access to a CNC lathe ... but this is a contest entry lots of folks would be interrested in </p>

                        <p> However it's too crude : the stop is instantaneous, meaning you most probably will loose steps and thus position accuracy if moving too fast. That's bad. </p>
                        <p> It pretty much makes that function an "emergency stop" instead of a pause button </p>
                        <p> A good contest entry would be to make this a soft pause : decelerate to a stop, then enter pause mode. The planner will take care of re-accelerating on restart without you worrying about that. But the deceleration needs to be implemented </p>
                        <p> It involves, when the pause button is pressed, refusing to add more blocks to the queue ( or the acceleration would be re-calculated, negating your efforts ), then recalculating the blocks in the queue to lead them to a full stop with deceleration, and finally, allow for restarting the machine </p>

                        <p> This is a relatively simple one : the bootloader doesn't currently check if the firmware is valid before flashing it </p>
                        <p> This causes some problems with users flashing the wrong file and the bootloader flashing garbage as a result </p>
                        <p> Adding checks for validity of the firmware file to the bootloader would solve this </p>
                        <p> There is some difficulty however, in that we have pretty much filled up the space alloted to the bootloader in flash, so you'll need to free a bit of it </p>

                          <p> While depending on speeds and resolution, Smoothieboard may not be able to support all encoder setups as-is ( due to processing power constraints ), it should still be quite useful in a lot of situations. </p>
                          <p> And with the future FPGA-enabled version of Smoothieboard, any processing power constraints will dissapear. </p>

                        <p> A tangential knife is essentially an additional axis to the machine that orients a knife ( usually an exacto-knife-type-thing ) in the same direction as the machine is moving. </p>
                        <p> This allows to cut with the cutting side of the blade facing what needs to be cut next. </p>
                        <p> It also opens some interresting possibilities such as integrating wires into extruded plastic on 3D printers, and other weird techniques </p>
                        <p> This is fairly simple to code : Create a new module, have it compute the current orientation, and have it move the rotational axis accordingly </p>

                        <p> CNC milling machines can do anything. They are awesome. One thing that's so great about them is that you can have tools in all shapes and forms for them, allowing you to do many different tasks efficiently </p>
                        <p> But what happens if you need to use several different tools in making a single part ? Two solutions, both of which are possible with Smoothie's standard features, but would be much better with some code designed specifically for them : </p>
                        <h4> Manual tool change </h4>
                        <p> This is how this works : you put a special G-code in your G-code file at the point where the tool needs to be changed. 
                        When Smoothie encounters that G-code, it stops the machine, you change the tool, and Smoothie waits for you to press a button before starting again. </p>
                        <p> This is fairly simple to code/add. </p>
                        <h4> Automated tool change </h4>
                        <p> This is pretty much the same thing, but the machine automatically takes care of changing the tool for you. </p>
                        <p> This means the machine must be aware of where the tools are ( that can be set in the configuration file ), and has a procedure of movement and actions to change to each tool. </p>
                        <p> This is a bit more complex to add, but it would be so cool to see in action, and it's very very useful </p>

                        <p> The parameters supported are the I and J parameters, defining a relative target point to the current position. </p>
                        <p> However, some G-code generators generate files that use the R ( radius ) parameter instead. </p>
                        <p> Adding support for this would make Smoothie supported by more G-code generators ( in particular Inkscape's G-code plugin ) </p>
                        <p> It requires a bit of knowledge of math, but the code should be fairly simple as it's similar to what's already in there. </p>

                        <p> But the thing is, it was coded a long while ago, and nobody has used it since. So it may need a bit of fixing and love, and maybe move a few things to newer functionalities added to Smoothie </p>

                          your slicing program can just tell Smoothie what volume of filament to extrude proportional to the distance travelled. </p> 
                          <p> To do this you have to tell Smoothie what is the diameter of your filament </p>
                          <p> What's great about this is that if you could have Smoothie measure the diameter of your filament by itself, it'd eliminate all the problems associated with 
                          filament diameters being out of spec, or filament diameter varying across a roll of filament </p>
                          <p> To do this you must find an adequate sensor, and add a bit of code to the Extruder module </p>

                          <p> Plastic is awesome, but we don't handle it very gently. </p>
                          <p> Hobbed gears push the filament into your hotend, but by doing so it puts quite a bit of stress on the plastic, and sometimes, it eats it to the point it's not able to push it anymore </p>
                          <p> And sometimes your hotend gets clogged and you can't get anything to pass through it anymore </p>
                          <p> Also on <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Erik%27s_Bowden_Extruder"> Bowden </a> setups, there can be a delay between your gear pushing the filament, and the movement happening at the end of the tube </p>
                          <p> The problem in all of these is that the electronics are not aware of whether or not the filament is actually moving, and at what speed. It just tells the filament to move, it does not know if/how it does </p>
                          <p> If someone were to add encoder reading of filament movement close to the hotend to the Extruder module, it would allow to detect problems, and to get better flow in bowden setups </p>
                          <p> This is pretty experimental, but would be so awesome </p>

                          <p> Smoothie is modular. This means every function is separated into modules. There is one for extruders, one for lasers, etc ... </p>
                          <p> This is pretty nice as it allows you to code a new function as a module by adding a single file and not having to mingle in the core of Smoothie or know ( too much ) about it </p>
                          <p> This makes contributions easier, and the code base much cleaner </p>
                          <p> However, when this modular system was initially coded, not too much care was taken for memory usage </p>
                          <p> There is a queue system in Smoothie in which commands are stacked for later execution </p>
                          <p> This allows to look forward to future movements to accurately plan acceleration </p>
                          <p> However, the way we did it, we currently store G-codes along with movements so that G-codes get executed at the right time </p>
                          <p> This is very memory inneficient </p>
                          <p> Smoothie needs a refactor in which instead of storing full G-codes, modules are allowed to store only single pieces of data into the queue ( by having their own, smaller and synchronous queue ) </p>
                          <p> This would not only allow for lower RAM usage, but also for faster processing speed in the real-time parts of Smoothie </p>
                          <p> This is quite a lot of work, but we know what needs to be done and we can help </p>

                          <p> Smoothie has a pretty neat configuration system that allows you to configure pretty much everything using a single configuration file on the SD card.</p>
                          <p> No more recompiling, no more reflashing. That makes quite a few people happy </p>
                          <p> Internally, Smoothie reads the whole configuration file, parses it, stores it in RAM and then allows each module to request values when they initialize </p>
                          <p> This is inneficient in several ways : it is overly complex, it takes up a lot of RAM, and it makes reloading config complicated </p>
                          <p> For a while the community has been considering what we call the "config refactor" </p>
                          <p> Essentially Smoothie would just read the whole configuration file, and then, for each line encountered, call an event. Each module could check if it's a value it is interrested in, and act from that </p>
                          <p> Much simpler, much better, much smoothier </p>
                          <p> The main problem here is, it requires changing the configuration section of -all- of Smoothie's modules, which is quite a bit of work </p>

                          in-browser CAD design, in-browser/cloud slicing and CAM, and lots of neat things like this that would make this a true next-generation control interface </p>

                          <p> "All" you need to know is HTML/CSS/Javascript. If you know some of that, contributing to the web interface would make a nice contest entry. There is too much to do to list here really, but contact us and we can give you ideas </p>

                          <p> Documenting everything in detail is great, but it's not necessarily what you need if you just want to get started as soon as possible <p>
                          <p> Who wants to read everything ( and we have a lot ) if you really need just a part of it in your specific case </p>
                          <p> That's why we wrote the three guides we have so far : <a href="http://smoothieware.org/3d-printer-guide"> 3D printer </a>, <a href="http://smoothieware.org/CNC-Mill-guide"> CNC mill </a> and <a href="http://smoothieware.org/laser-cutter-guide"> Laser cutter</a> </p>
                          <p> But we need more guides ! Deltas are pretty complex to setup, we need a good guide for that. That's a big subject but there are simpler ones : setting up network connectivity, how to install and use host software ( Pronterface for example ), how to ground a machine properly ( for dummies, which most of us are when it comes to that ), or how to wire and use external stepper motor drivers </p>
                          <p> Also, the existing guides need love. Things can be made clearer, and more can be said </p>
                          <p> Any contribution to the guides, or new guides, are good contest entries </p>

                        appeared a few years back on ebay. They are insanely cheap, and are probably the cheapest way ever to get a 40W laser cutter that can cut plywood and acrylic </p>
                        <p> They are not very sturdy or well finished, but they do work. And did you see that price ? </p>
                        <p> Now the thing is : the electronics that come with it are truly horrible. As in : won't even work most of the time, locked with a DRM-type thumb drive, and will only work with a horribly hard to use interface </p>
                        <p> On the other hand, putting a Smoothieboard in those makes them much nicer. This is actually the first machine a Smoothieboard was ever run in </p>

                              I look after Hackspace Manchester's CNC gear, and have performed similar conversions before, such as getting our laser cutter working with a LAOS board: 
                              <a href="http://wiki.hacman.org.uk/Laser_Cutter/Conversion"> Link </a>
                              </p> 
                              <p>  
                              I'm also currently working with another member to perform a reversible smoothie conversion of a Roland CAMM3 CNC machine we have on long-term loan: <a href="https://github.com/thinkl33t/CAMM3-SMOOTHIE"> Link </a>
                              </p> 
                              <p>  
                              The idea behind this is that if the CNC ever needs to be returned, it can be returned to its original state easily, but is far more usable in the interim.

                              <li> Move as much of Smoothie as possible to use the mBed libraries </li>
                              <li> Test and make sure everything works </li>
                              <li> Disable everything in Smoothie </li>
                              <li> Get the gutted Smoothie to compile and run for M4 mBed </li>
                              <li> Re-enable things in Smoothie one by one, port as needed </li>
                          </ul>
                        </p>

        <h2>Who is doing this ?</h2>
        <footer> Us ! </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p> This is a joint effort between <a href="http://uberclock.com">Uberclock</a> and <a href="http://robotseed.com">Robotseed</a>, the two companies currently producing and selling the Smoothieboard. Our two companies are also run by folks that actively contribute to the project, and this contest is a part of that. </p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
        <h2>Why do this ?</h2>
        <footer> Many reasons ! </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h3> Enabling </h3>

    <p>From time to time we hear somebody saying something like : </p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p> « I have an awesome idea of something to add to Smoothie, but I don't have a Smoothieboard. And I can't get one right now » </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p> That breaks our hearts. Sometimes we can do something, sometimes we can't. Right now we can, and we'd like to find as many people like this as possible </p>

    <h3> Involving </h3>

    <p> Contributing to an Open-Source project is easier than it seems. But not everybody necessarily realizes that </p>

    <p> Contributing to Smoothie is easy. That's actually one of the main design goals for the project. If you want to help us, we want to make your life as easy as possible ( the code is actually structured <a href="http://smoothieware.org/moduleexample">with that in mind</a> ). </p>

    <p> But that's not something that is in any way obvious, or easy to show. So the best way to get people to see it is give them a good reason to try it, and then let them tell others their experience. </p>

    <h3> Giving back </h3>

    <p> <a href="https://github.com/arthurwolf">I</a> was part of the first <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1"> Google Summer of Code </a>. And it was awesome ! </p>

    <p> We are not Google. But it is nonetheless an inspiring initiative. And we'd like to do as much as we can to move things forward </p>

    <h3> Awareness </h3>

    <p> How many times do we hear things like : </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p> « Wait, Smoothie can do <strong> that </strong> ? » </p>
        <footer> Everybody we talk to </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p> or </p> 

    <blockquote>
        <p> « I had no idea it was that far along. This is so much easier to use than what I was using before. » </p>
        <footer> A newcomer </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p> or also </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p> « I was surprised how easy it was to add my stuff to it. » </p>
        <footer> A new contributor </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p> That's pretty frustrating to hear : we have an awesome community that made something awesome, and is making it better all the time, but in the wider Open-Source CNC community, there is not much awareness about what is possible with it, and even about what it is exactly. </p>

    <p> Everybody is used to using other things, and to what is possible with those, so we have a hard time getting the word out about what makes Smoothie the project we love. </p> 

    <p> So we thought a contest was a good way to showcase what's already so awesome about it, what's currently being added, and how easy it is to add things to Smoothie. </p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" role="alert"><h4> « Smoothie is awesome, Smoothie is this and that » ... There are other awesome CNC projects around ! </h4> 
      <p> Sure, we love everything Open-Source ! Go look at other projects, maybe there are some better suited for you. <br/>
      </p>
    </div>
